# wojciechjozaf-automation-portfolio
Welcome to my automation portfolio! This repository is a comprehensive demonstration of my skills in building robust, scalable, and maintainable end-to-end (E2E) testing frameworks. 🚀
🎯 Project Goal

The core destination of this project is to showcase professional-grade test automation using Playwright and TypeScript. Instead of simple scripts, I focused on implementing industry-standard architectural patterns that ensure tests are stable and easy to extend.
🛠 Tech Stack

    Engine: Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) 🎭

    Language: TypeScript for type safety and better DX ⌨️

    Pattern: Page Object Model (POM) for clean code separation 🏗️

    Reporting: Allure Report / Playwright HTML Report 📊

    CI/CD: GitHub Actions integration ⚙️

✨ Key Features & Patterns implemented:

    Page Object Model (POM): Full abstraction of UI elements from test logic.

    Data-Driven Testing: Utilizing external JSON/Test Data files to run multiple scenarios.

    Advanced Locators: Using getByRole, getByText, and custom test-ids for resilient selectors.

    API Testing: Integrated REST API checks within the UI flow to ensure data integrity.

    Parallel Execution: Configured for maximum speed without losing stability.

    Custom Utilities: Helper functions for common actions like waiting, logging, or state handling.
